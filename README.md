This is some weird code I wrote as a graduate student, and I always come up with weird ideas sometimes. My main research direction is partial least squares algorithm, mainly using matlab language and python, occasionally mixed with some Cpp
Since I'm too lazy to write an English note, maybe I'll write it when I think of it that day
It should be noted that the matrix calculation efficiency of python is obviously not as high as that of matlab
At the same time, I didn't do multi-thread optimization, or I didn't think about how to use multi-thread optimization, so the CPU utilization was only 50%
